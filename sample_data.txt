# Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP) and RAG

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that allows AI models to interact with external tools and data sources. It creates a bridge between the AI's reasoning capabilities and actions in the real world.

Key features:
- Connects AI models to real-time data beyond their training cutoff
- Enables interaction with external APIs and services
- Allows complex tasks to be broken down into manageable steps
- Maintains consistent behavior across different environments

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG combines the generative capabilities of large language models with the precision of information retrieval systems.

How RAG works:
1. The AI interprets a user's request
2. The system searches through a knowledge base for relevant information
3. Retrieved information is added to the AI's context
4. The AI produces a response that incorporates both its intrinsic knowledge and the retrieved information

## Benefits of Combining MCP and RAG

When used together, MCP and RAG create powerful AI systems that can:
- Provide more accurate and up-to-date information
- Take actions based on contextual understanding
- Access specialized knowledge bases
- Reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy
- Customize outputs based on specific organizational knowledge
